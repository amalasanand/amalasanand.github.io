  <p>Hi, I'm Amala! I'm passionate about cybersecurity and building my career in threat detection and SOC roles.</p>
  <p>I’m a passionate cybersecurity professional with a foundation in manual application testing and a growing focus on threat detection, SOC analysis, and Blue Team operations.<p> My career began in software quality assurance, where I honed my skills in testing, Agile methodologies, JIRA, and process optimization—ensuring software not only functioned well but met performance and reliability standards.
As I immersed myself deeper into the world of cybersecurity, I discovered a profound interest in understanding how systems break—and more importantly, how to protect them. This led me to pursue certifications like CEH and CPT, and to build a personal home lab for simulating attacks, analyzing logs, and learning defensive strategies with tools like Splunk, Wireshark, Sysmon, and VirtualBox.</p>
<p>I’ve completed virtual internships with PwC and Mastercard, where I executed phishing simulations, performed risk assessments, implemented security baselines, and learned the critical importance of proactive defense. Alongside that, I’ve trained in Microsoft SC-900 and am pursuing CompTIA Security+ to further strengthen my knowledge of modern security architecture.</p>
<p>My mission is to bridge the gap between application testing, security automation, and real-world threat response, helping organizations stay resilient in the face of evolving cyber risks. I believe cybersecurity isn’t just about tools—it’s about mindset, collaboration, and continuous learning. I’m deeply invested in building efficient, scalable security workflows using platforms like SOAR, ServiceNow, and JIRA, while fostering awareness and best practices across teams.</p>
<p>Let’s connect if you’re working in security, testing, threat detection, or incident response—or if you're simply passionate about building secure, future-ready systems. I’m always open to learning, collaborating, and growing with this incredible community</p>
