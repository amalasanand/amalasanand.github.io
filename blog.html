  <h1>Manifesting to be a SOC Analyst( through learning )</h1>

  <h2>Learning phase 1</h2>
  <p> Manifesting to be a SOC Analyst</p>
<p>🛠️ Learning Phase 1: Laying the Foundation</p>
Breaking into cybersecurity may seem intimidating at first — full of acronyms, advanced tools, and technical concepts. But like any good system, the path to becoming a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst can be built step-by-step. This is my learning phase 1 — and I hope it becomes a roadmap for others on the same journey.

<p>🧭 Why SOC Analyst?</p>
<p>SOC Analysts are the first line of defense in detecting, analyzing, and responding to cyber threats. It's hands-on, real-time, and meaningful. If you enjoy solving puzzles, learning constantly, and protecting systems, this could be your ideal role.</p>

<p>🪜 How to Start — A Beginner’s Pathway</p>
<p>1. Understand the Basics of IT and Networking</p>
<p>You can't defend what you don't understand. Start here:</p>

<p>Learn how the internet works: IPs, DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls.</p>

<p>>Use resources like:</p

<p>Cisco Networking Basics (free)</p>

<p>Professor Messer’s CompTIA Network+ videos (YouTube)</p>

<p>📌 Tip: Set up a simple home network and explore how devices connect, ping, and transfer data.</p>

2. Get Comfortable with Operating Systems (Windows/Linux)
SOC Analysts often deal with both environments:

Practice basic Linux commands.

Learn Windows event logs and task manager basics.

Try using:

TryHackMe’s “Intro to Windows” or “Intro to Linux” rooms

[VirtualBox or VMware to build a lab]

3. Begin Cybersecurity-Focused Learning
Start small — get a feel for security terminology and processes:

Free beginner-friendly platforms:

TryHackMe – SOC Level 1 Learning Path

BlueTeamLabs Online (BTLO)

Cybrary or LetsDefend

🎯 Goal: Understand what a log looks like, what an alert means, and how SOC teams respond.

4. Learn Basic Tools
Start with tools every SOC Analyst will likely encounter:

Wireshark – for network packet analysis.

Splunk (Free version) – for log searching and detection rules.

Microsoft Defender, Sysmon, Event Viewer – for endpoint and system logging.

You don’t need to master everything — just understand what they do and how to start using them.

5. Build a Home Lab
Nothing beats hands-on experience. Here’s what I did:

Used VirtualBox to run a Kali Linux attacker and Windows 10 victim.

Installed Sysmon on Windows and sent logs to Splunk.

Practiced phishing simulations, malware testing, and IOC extraction.

🔒 This helps you safely experiment and understand the “why” behind alerts in a SOC.

6. Certifications & Learning Tracks
Some entry-level certifications to validate your learning:

SC-900 (Microsoft Security Fundamentals)

CompTIA Security+ (if you're aiming for something vendor-neutral)

TryHackMe Certificates, LetsDefend Progress

🔁 My Progress So Far (and What’s Next)
✅ Built a home lab with Splunk, Sysmon, and VirtualBox

✅ Completed SC-900 self-paced learning via Microsoft Learn

✅ Finished phishing simulation project (Mastercard internship)

✅ Explored network segmentation and risk assessment (PwC internship)

⏳ Working on completing the Security+

🧩 Final Thoughts
Becoming a SOC Analyst doesn’t require perfection — it requires persistence. Learn daily, test things out, break them, fix them, and stay curious. Everyone’s path is different, and it’s okay to start small.

This is just Phase 1. Stay tuned for Learning Phase 2 — where I’ll dive deeper into log analysis, threat detection, and real-world triaging strategies.</p>
