  <h1>Manifesting to be a SOC Analyst( through learning )</h1>

  <h2>Learning phase 1</h2>
  <p> Manifesting to be a SOC Analyst</p>
<p>🛠️ Learning Phase 1: Laying the Foundation</p>
Breaking into cybersecurity may seem intimidating at first — full of acronyms, advanced tools, and technical concepts. But like any good system, the path to becoming a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst can be built step-by-step. This is my learning phase 1 — and I hope it becomes a roadmap for others on the same journey.

<p>🧭 Why SOC Analyst?</p>
<p>SOC Analysts are the first line of defense in detecting, analyzing, and responding to cyber threats. It's hands-on, real-time, and meaningful. If you enjoy solving puzzles, learning constantly, and protecting systems, this could be your ideal role.</p>

<p>🪜 How to Start — A Beginner’s Pathway</p>
<p>1. Understand the Basics of IT and Networking
You can't defend what you don't understand. Start here:</p>
<p>Learn how the internet works: IPs, DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls.</p>

 <p>Use resources like:</p
<p>-->Cisco Networking Basics (free)</p>
<p>-->Professor Messer’s CompTIA Network+ videos (YouTube)</p>

<p>📌 Tip: Set up a simple home network and explore how devices connect, ping, and transfer data.</p>

<p>2. Get Comfortable with Operating Systems (Windows/Linux)</p>

<p>SOC Analysts often deal with both environments:</p>
<p>Practice basic Linux commands.</p>
<p>Learn Windows event logs and task manager basics.</p>

<p>Try using:

<p>-->TryHackMe’s “Intro to Windows” or “Intro to Linux” rooms</p>
<p>-->[VirtualBox or VMware to build a lab]</p>

<p>3.Begin Cybersecurity-Focused Learning</p>

<p>Start small — get a feel for security terminology and processes:</p>
<p>Free beginner-friendly platforms:</p>
<p>-->TryHackMe – SOC Level 1 Learning Path</p>
<p>-->BlueTeamLabs Online (BTLO)</p>
<p>-->Cybrary or LetsDefend

<p>🎯 Goal: Understand what a log looks like, what an alert means, and how SOC teams respond.</p>

<p>4. Learn Basic Tools</p>
<p>Start with tools every SOC Analyst will likely encounter:</p>
<p>-->Wireshark – for network packet analysis.</p>
<p>-->Splunk (Free version) – for log searching and detection rules.</p>
<p>-->Microsoft Defender, Sysmon, Event Viewer – for endpoint and system logging.</p>

<p>You don’t need to master everything — just understand what they do and how to start using them.</p>

<p>5. Build a Home Lab</p>
<p>Nothing beats hands-on experience. Here’s what I did:</p>
<p>-->Used VirtualBox to run a Kali Linux attacker and Windows 10 victim.</p>
<p>-->Installed Sysmon on Windows and sent logs to Splunk.</p>
<p>-->Practiced phishing simulations, malware testing, and IOC extraction.</p>

<p>🔒 This helps you safely experiment and understand the “why” behind alerts in a SOC.</p>

<p>6. Certifications & Learning Tracks</p>
<p>Some entry-level certifications to validate your learning:</p>
<p>-->SC-900 (Microsoft Security Fundamentals)</p>
<p>-->CompTIA Security+ (if you're aiming for something vendor-neutral)</p>
<p>-->TryHackMe Certificates, LetsDefend Progress</p>

<p>🧩 Final Thoughts</p>
<p>Becoming a SOC Analyst doesn’t require perfection — it requires persistence. Learn daily, test things out, break them, fix them, and stay curious. Everyone’s path is different, and it’s okay to start small.</p>

<p>This is just Phase 1. Stay tuned for Learning Phase 2 — where I’ll dive deeper into log analysis, threat detection, and real-world triaging strategies.</p>
